Version 1.1.1


CHANGED FILENAMES TO BE MORE ACCURATE:
-Bank.java -> ChargeFileManager.java

-BankInterface.java -> ChargeInterface.java

-BankOpInterface.java -> ChargeOpInterface.java


ARCHITECTURE:
Interface classes no longer extend ChargeFileManager.java. This was done to make ChargeFileManager.java more of a general-purpose class to operate on the database that will be used when a fully-fledged application is developed. The interface subclasses won't be needed for that.

ChargeViewer.java class created to contain console UI display methods used by both interface classes. Both interface classes inherit this class. This means that ChargeOpInterface.java doesn't inherit unneeded methods from ChargeInterface.java like selectAccount() and selectMonth().
